    Liquid democracy offers a flexible alternative to traditional methods of voting, allowing individuals to either vote directly or delegate their vote to a trusted peer. This project integrates a comprehensive liquid democracy system into vodle, an existing open-source platform for web-based group decision-making, to enable more flexible and inclusive participation.

    The implementation introduces several key features: transitive delegation, ranked delegation with backup options, per-option delegation, and weighted delegation. These features provide flexible, reliable, and secure delegation, supporting varying levels of user engagement and expertise.

    By combining technical innovations with an intuitive interface, vodle ensures that users can participate in decision-making even when they are not continuously active, making liquid democracy practical for real-time, web-based environments.
