%A project to enhance rating systems with liquid democracy features, focusing on implementing and analysing various delegation mechanisms within the Vodle decision making system.
This project explores how liquid democracy can be used to enhance rating systems by integrating it into vodle, an online polling platform where users rate options using sliders. Traditional liquid democracy models do not always reflect participants' true preferences, especially when some users abstain from voting or when some individuals gain too much influence. To address this, the project adds support for ranked delegation and weighted vote splitting.
