\label{ch:background}

This chapter provides background context for the development of a liquid democracy system within Vodle. It builds on the concepts introduced earlier, focusing on more detailed research into known limitations of liquid democracy and potential solutions proposed in academic literature. Additionally, the technical foundations and design philosophy of Vodle as a platform are explored.

Throughout this chapter, several diagrams are used to illustrate how votes move through a liquid democracy system. To clarify the roles of different voters, the following symbols are used:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Circles} indicate voters who delegate their vote to someone else.
    \item \textbf{Squares} represent voters who cast their own vote and do not delegate.
    \item \textbf{Triangles} show voters who abstain - neither voting directly nor delegating to others.
\end{itemize}

\section{Liquid Democracy}

Liquid democracy, or delegative voting, allows voters to either cast a vote directly, delegate it to someone they trust, or abstain \citep{blum_liquid_2016}. A key feature is that delegations are transitive - a chain of users that all delegate to each other sequentially ends with a single final voter who casts their vote on behalf of all those in the chain.

Whilst the transitivity property enables concentration of voting power with trusted individuals, it can also lead to unintended consequences. Chains of delegations may result in cycles that prevent votes from being cast, or allow certain individuals to accumulate an excessive share of influence, creating so-called super-voters. These problems amongst others motivate the need for alternative delegation mechanisms, as discussed in the following subsections.

%\cite{ford_delegative_2002} argues that direct democracy becomes ineffective at scale due to the diversity in participants' knowledge and interest. Without mechanisms to channel influence through trusted intermediaries, the collective outcome may reflect average rather than informed decision-making. Liquid democracy addresses this by enabling voters to shift influence toward participants with greater expertise or engagement.

\subsection{Issues with Liquid Democracy}

\subsubsection{Delegation cycles}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, thick, scale=1.5]
        % Nodes at triangle vertices
        \node[circle, draw] (A) at (0,0) {A};
        \node[circle, draw] (B) at (2,0) {B};
        \node[circle, draw] (C) at (1,1.732) {C}; % height = sqrt(3)

        % Arrows showing delegation
        \draw (A) -- (B);
        \draw (B) -- (C);
        \draw (C) -- (A);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Delegation cycle: A delegates to B, B to C, and C back to A.}
    \label{fig:triangle-cycle}
\end{figure}


Delegation cycles occur when a vote is delegated in such a way that it ends up forming a loop \citep{brill_liquid_2022}, preventing the vote from reaching a final, resolvable destination. For example, if Alice delegates her vote to Bob, Bob delegates to Charlie, and Charlie delegates back to Alice, the votes become trapped in a cycle (seen above) and can be treated as a loss of representation \citep{christoff2017liquiddemocracyanalysisbinary}.

This issue is particularly problematic because it can nullify votes without the affected users ever realising. In systems where cycles are not explicitly detected and handled, these votes are discarded silently, potentially changing the final outcome of the votes.

Delegation cycles are increasingly likely to emerge in dynamic voting systems, where delegations can be added, removed, or modified at any point in time. Delegations that initially did not form part of a cycle may later contribute to one as other voters add a new delegation or alter an existing one.

\subsubsection{Abstentions}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, thick, node distance=2.5cm]
        \node[circle, draw] (A) {A};
        \node[circle, draw, right of=A] (B) {B};
        \node[regular polygon, regular polygon sides=3, shape border rotate=0, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=0pt, right of=B] (C) {C};

        \draw (A) -- (B);
        \draw (B) -- (C);
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Delegation chain ending in abstention: A delegates to B, B to C. C abstains, causing the votes of A and B to be lost.}
    \label{fig:delegation-abstention}
\end{figure}

In liquid democracy, abstention is where a voter neither casts a vote nor delegates their vote to another user \citep{brill_liquid_2022}. This includes both deliberate abstention, where a voter knowingly chooses not to participate, and passive abstention, where a voter may be unaware of an ongoing poll or are unable to engage with it.

Abstentions are especially impactful when they occur at the end of a larger delegation chain, as all votes passed along the chain to that voter are effectively lost \citep{brill_liquid_2022}. The voters whose decisions were passed along the chain may also be unaware that their votes have been nullified, worsening the effect of the abstention.

\subsubsection{Super-voters}
In liquid democracy, a super-voter is an individual who receives a large number of delegated votes, therefore gaining disproportionate influence over decisions \citep{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline}. While this behaviour may reflect voters' genuine preferences, it can lead to a concentration of power that goes against the intended egalitarianism and democratic ideals of liquid democracy.

Although liquid democracy allows users to alter their delegation at any time, in practice, many voters may not actively monitor or even know how their vote is being used. This can allow a small number of super-voters to dominate outcomes, especially in systems with large delegation chains.

Real-world examples of this phenomenon have been documented. In the German Pirate Party's use of LiquidFeedback, certain users received so many delegations that their votes were like ``decrees'' \citep{sven_becker_liquid_2012,kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline} even though they were not elected officials. \cite{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline} noted that the super-voters generally voted in line with the majority, therefore not drastically affecting the outcome of the votes and contributed to the stability of the system. However, the potential for individuals to single-handedly influence the results remained a concern.
%This pattern has also been observed in blockchain-based governance systems \citep{hallWhatHappensWhen2024}, where voting tokens (digital representations of voting power) are commonly concentrated among a few delegates, giving them an excessive amount of power.
%In the case of the Pirate Party, analysis showed that although super-voters held significant theoretical power, they generally voted in line with the majority, therefore not drastically affecting the outcome of the votes. \cite{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline} described this behaviour as voting "wisely," noting that while these individuals had the capacity to change outcomes, they typically did not use it to push their own agenda.

This pattern is not limited to traditional online voting platforms. It can also be seen within decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) - blockchain-based entities where decisions are made collectively by token holders without central leadership. These organisations use token-based voting to decide on critical issues like protocol upgrades and funding allocations. \cite{hallWhatHappensWhen2024} studied 18 decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) and found that voting power was often concentrated in the hands of a few delegates. While most did not control a large share of all available tokens, low participation meant that their share of actual votes cast was disproportionately high. In several DAOs, the top five delegates accounted for over 50\% of all votes cast, and in the DAO Gitcoin, this figure exceeded 90\%.
\subsection{Variations of Liquid Democracy}

\subsubsection{Ranked delegation} Allows voters to specify fall-back delegates in order of preference (Brill et al., 2022).

Include different algorithms from Brill paper

\subsubsection{Weighted/ vote splitting}
Voting power is distributed across multiple delegates to reduce reliance on any single individual (\cite{golz_fluid_2021}).

\subsubsection{Backup votes - kinda unneeded}
Voters may provide a direct vote to use in case delegation fails.

\subsection{Google Votes}

\section{vodle}
Vodle is a web-based platform for participatory group decision-making. Users participate in polls that allow them to rate a set of options using sliders. When the poll ends, these ratings are aggregated and the MaxParC rating system is used to determine the final result of the poll.

\subsection{MaxParC}
Understanding MaxParC is important for this project because it forms the core of how vodle interprets group preferences. Since this work involves modifying vodle's voting behaviour through the integration of liquid democracy, it is essential to understand how MaxParC processes input ratings. In particular, understanding how changes in individual ratings influence the final outcome of a poll helps to frame the implications of delegating or reweighting votes.
%A clear grasp of MaxParC's underlying principles allows for a more informed and effective integration that maintains the platform's commitment to fairness and consensus.

Maximum Partial Consensus (MaxParC), the rating system used by vodle, was introduced by \cite{heitzig_fair_2024}. It is a decision-making method designed to address the limitations of traditional voting systems, in particular the potential for majority rule to suppress minority viewpoints.
The primary objective of MaxParC is to achieve a balance between fairness, consensus, and efficiency in group decision-making.

Each voter rates an option from $0$ to $100$ ($x$), representing their willingness to approve that option if and only if $<x\%$ of users do not approve that option. Therefore, a rating of $0$ means ``do no approve no matter what'' and a rating of $100$ means ``approve no matter what'' or ``always approve''.
