Through the background research, we identified several key limitations in traditional liquid democracy systems such as delegation cycles, vote loss through abstentions, and the disproportionate influence of super-voters. We also explored a number of proposed enhancements, including ranked delegation and vote splitting, which offer practical ways to improve the robustness and fairness of delegative voting.

Based on these findings, we propose a set of features that would improve vodle and make the integration of liquid democracy within it more beneficial. These can be formalised into the following core objectives:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Design and implement a foundational delegation framework for the vodle platform, enabling users to delegate their votes to other participants.

    \item Extend the core delegation model to support ranked delegation, allowing users to specify an ordered list of preferred delegates.

    \item Implement a vote splitting mechanism to enable users to distribute their voting power among multiple delegates.

    \item Introduce option-specific delegation, allowing users to assign different delegates for different options within a poll.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, the following extension objective can be identified as it is not completely aligned to the project goal \dots

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Perform offline agent based simulations to analyse the effectiveness of various delegation system, including those implemented in the project.
\end{enumerate}
