    Liquid democracy offers a flexible alternative to traditional voting methods, allowing individuals to either vote directly or delegate their vote to trusted peers. This project integrates a full liquid democracy system into vodle, a web-based group decision-making platform, to support broader and more accessible participation.

    Several new delegation features were developed: ranked delegation with backup options, per-option delegation, and weighted delegation based on user-defined trust. These innovations give users more control over how their votes are cast, even when they are not directly participating.

    By combining these delegation features with an intuitive interface, the platform makes liquid democracy practical for real-time, web-based environments.
