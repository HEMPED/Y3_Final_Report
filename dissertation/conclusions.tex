\section{Author's Assessment of the Project}
``It can be a useful exercise for you (and a point of consolidation for the reader) to put together a brief summary of what you have achieved. This is not a compulsory section, but a self-assessment is welcome. A suggested format for this is to include a short section entitled 'Author's Assessment of the Project' consisting of brief (up to 100 words) answers to each of the following questions.

\begin{itemize}
\item What is the (technical) contribution of this project?
\item Why should this contribution be considered relevant and important for the subject of your degree?
\item How can others make use of the work in this project?
\item Why should this project be considered an achievement?
\item What are the limitations of this project?
\end{itemize}''
