\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}


Evaluate each objective against requirements. Add a summary type thing for each of them.
Add a forward ref in design and implementation to this section.

For each requirement we can talk about how we evaluated it -- eg going to need to do some offline testing / unit testing for some non functional ones


\section{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item unit testing for delegation algorithms (minsum, weighted delegation and test cycle checking for standard delegation)
    \item make sure all requirements are done (can format as table)
\end{itemize}
\section{Requirements Evaluation - TODO After Requirements are 100\% Done}
The following section evaluates the project against the requirements set out in section \ref{ch:project_objectives}. For each objective, their corresponding requirements are listed, along with a brief description of how they were/ were not met.

\subsection{Core Objective 1: Implement a Core Delegation Model into Vodle}
\subsection{Core Objective 2: Implement Ranked Delegation into Vodle}
\subsection{Core Objective 3: Implement Weighted Delegation into Vodle}
\subsection{Core Objective 4: Implement the Ability to Delegate Individual Options to Different Users}
\subsection{Extension Objective 1: Simulate Delegation Mechanisms}

\section{Feedback From Customer}
get quote from Jobst: what he likes and dislikes about the implementation. also include specifications about what the final delegation implementation will be (weighted delegation).
