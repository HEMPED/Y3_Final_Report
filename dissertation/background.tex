\chapter{Background Research}\label{ch:background}
This chapter provides the necessary foundation for designing and implementing a liquid democracy system within vodle. It begins by comparing liquid democracy to traditional models (direct and representative democracy), highlighting its potential to balance transparency, scalability, and individual agency.

The chapter then examines key limitations of liquid democracy in practice -- including delegation cycles, abstentions, and the emergence of super-voters -- alongside the strategies proposed in the literature to mitigate them.

Furthermore, real-world deployments of liquid democracy are considered, drawing lessons from systems such as LiquidFeedback and Google Votes. These examples inform both the technical feasibility and design challenges of integrating delegation mechanisms into online platforms.

Finally, the chapter outlines the technical foundations of vodle, including its architecture and existing (incomplete) delegation features. These constraints play a key role in shaping the design choices presented in later chapters.
\section{Liquid Democracy}

While liquid democracy was briefly introduced in Chapter~\ref{ch:introduction}, this section provides a more detailed rationale for its relevance -- particularly in the context of decision-making systems like vodle.

\textbf{Direct democracy} maximises personal agency and transparency by allowing individuals to vote on every issue. It is often viewed as the most egalitarian form of governance, as it ensures that all participants have a direct say in decisions. However, this model becomes impractical at scale. Expecting all users to remain consistently informed and engaged across all relevant knowledge areas is unrealistic, particularly in large or diverse groups \citep{ford_delegative_2002}. As \citet{ford_delegative_2002} observes, the assumption that the majority can or will make consistently well-informed decisions across a broad range of topics does not hold in practice. This can lead to voter fatigue, low turnout, and uninformed or irrational decision-making.

\textbf{Representative democracy} addresses some of these issues (particularly scalability) by allowing users to elect officials who vote on their behalf. This model forms the basis of most modern democracies, enabling stable governance in large populations. It allows representatives, who have develop expertise, to reduce the decision-making burden on the general population. However, the model has key limitations: between elections, representatives may act without sufficient accountability, and voters have limited influence over individual decisions \citep{blum_liquid_2016}. As a result, the outcomes of decision-making can become misaligned with the preferences and interests of individual voters.

\textbf{Liquid democracy} attempts to reconcile these competing trade-offs. It allows each participant to either vote directly or delegate (entrust) their vote to another participant (a delegate). Delegates can in turn delegate their votes, forming chains of trust. This is known as \textit{transitive delegation}: voting power is passed along the chain until it reaches a user who casts a vote. Delegations are also \textit{revocable}, allowing users to reclaim and reassign their vote at any time.

  \label{fig:delegation-transitivity}
\end{figure}

By supporting both direct and delegated participation, liquid democracy allows users to engage at varying levels depending on their interest, expertise, or availability. This flexibility makes it a promising model for decision making in online platforms such as vodle, where participation levels naturally fluctuate.

\subsection{Issues With Liquid Democracy}

Although liquid democracy offers an elegant compromise between agency and scalability, it introduces several non-trivial implementation challenges. This section identifies three core issues that threaten its reliability and fairness in practice: cycles in delegation chains, vote loss due to abstentions, and the disproportionate influence of super-voters.

To support this discussion, the following diagram legend is used to visually distinguish between voter behaviours:

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|}
  \hline
  \textbf{Role} & \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Symbol}\\ \hline
  \textbf{Delegated voter} & Has delegated their vote and does not cast one directly & Circle \\
  \textbf{Casting voter} & Casts their vote and has not delegated & Square \\
  \textbf{Abstaining voter} & Neither delegates nor casts their vote & Triangle \\
  \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Diagram legend showing symbols used for different voter behaviours in a liquid democracy context.}
\end{table}  

\subsection*{Delegation Cycles}\label{subsec:delegation_cycles}
Delegation cycles occur when a vote is delegated in such a way that it ends up forming a loop \citep{brill_liquid_2022}, preventing the vote from reaching a final casting voter. For example, if Alice delegates her vote to Bob, Bob delegates to Charlie, and Charlie delegates back to Alice, the votes become trapped in a cycle (see Figure~\ref{fig:triangle-cycle}) and can be treated as a loss of representation \citep{christoff2017liquiddemocracyanalysisbinary}.

Preventing such cycles is essential in vodle to ensure that delegated votes are always correctly resolved and that no voter's influence is lost without their knowledge.

\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, thick, scale=1.5]
    % Nodes at triangle vertices
    \node[circle, draw] (A) at (0,0) {A};
    \node[circle, draw] (B) at (2,0) {B};
    \node[circle, draw] (C) at (1,1.732) {C}; % height = sqrt(3)

    % Arrows showing delegation
    \draw (A) -- (B);
    \draw (B) -- (C);
    \draw (C) -- (A);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Delegation cycle: A delegates to B, B to C, and C back to A.}
  \label{fig:triangle-cycle}
\end{figure}

This issue is particularly problematic because it can nullify votes without the affected users' knowledge -- in implementations that do not properly handle cycles, the final decision-making outcome may be altered without participants realising it.
%these votes could be discarded silently, potentially changing the final outcome of the votes.

One straightforward method for preventing cycles is to validate each new delegation by checking whether it would introduce a loop. This requires inspecting the current delegation graph to ensure that the potential delegate does not indirectly delegate back to one delegating. However, in dynamic systems like vodle, where users can update delegations at any time, static checks are insufficient. Cycle detection must be continuous, ensuring that the delegation structure remains valid as participants modify their preferences. Designing an efficient, real-time validation mechanism is therefore critical to maintaining vote resolution reliability.

\subsection*{Abstentions}

A voter abstains\footnote{Abstention may be deliberate, with a voter intentionally choosing not to participate, or unintentional, due to lack of awareness of the poll or inability to engage.} by neither casting a vote nor delegating it to another user \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

Abstentions are especially impactful when they occur at the end of a larger delegation chain (see Figure~\ref{fig:delegation-abstention}), as all votes passed along the chain to that voter are effectively lost \citep{brill_liquid_2022}. Additionally, the voters whose decisions were passed along the chain may also be unaware that their votes have been nullified, worsening the effect of the abstention.

In vodle, this risk is especially critical, as lost votes directly undermine the project's goal of supporting broad participation while allowing users to delegate flexibly and retain influence.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \caption{Delegation chain ending in abstention: A delegates to B, B to C. C abstains, causing the votes of A and B to be lost.}
  \label{fig:delegation-abstention}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Super-Voters}\label{subsec:bg_supervoter}
\begin{figure}[H]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[->, >=stealth, thick, node distance=2.5cm, square/.style={regular polygon,regular polygon sides=4}]

    \node[square, draw, minimum size=1cm, inner sep=0pt, right of=D] (E) {E};

    \draw (A) -- (B);
    \draw (B) -- (C);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Super-voter: A delegates to B, B to C. No matter which vote D or E cast, C's vote will always determine the outcome as it has a weight of 3.}
  \label{fig:delegation-supervoter}
\end{figure}

In liquid democracy, a \textit{super-voter} is a user who receives a large number of delegations, thereby accumulating significant voting power \citep{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline}. While such concentration may arise from genuine trust, it risks creating imbalances that contradict the egalitarian goals of the system. Super-voters effectively act as unelected representatives -- potentially swaying results with little accountability.

Even when systems allow voters to revoke delegations at any time, many users may not actively monitor how their vote is used, leading to persistent power structures where a small number of users hold substantial, often unnoticed, influence over outcomes.

For example, in the German Pirate Party's use of LiquidFeedback, some participants became so dominant that their votes carried decree-like weight, even though they were not formally elected \citep{sven_becker_liquid_2012, kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline}. While \citet{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline} observed that these super-voters generally aligned with majority opinion, contributing to system stability rather than distorting it, their disproportionate influence still raises concerns about transparency and the extent to which individual voters retain meaningful control over their vote.

In the context of vodle, the emergence of super-voters poses a direct challenge to the platform's principles of user autonomy and proportional influence. If a small number of users were to receive the majority of delegations -- particularly through features like transitive or weighted delegation -- this could lead to persistent concentration of power, undermining the goal of a fair and balanced decision-making environment.

Beyond web-based implementations, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), which use token-based voting on blockchains, have also experienced similar power concentration challenges. \citet{hallWhatHappensWhen2024} found that in many DAOs, voting power was highly concentrated among a few delegates due to low overall participation. In some cases, such as \textit{Gitcoin}, over 90\% of votes cast were controlled by the top five delegates. Although DAOs operate within blockchain environments rather than web platforms like vodle, these patterns underline the need for safeguards against disproportionate power accumulation across all liquid democracy systems.

These examples emphasise the importance of delegation mechanisms that can curb excessive power accumulation. Techniques such as weighted delegation and capping the maximum voting power of an individual are essential to preserving fairness, especially in vodle, which aims to uphold proportional representation and protect minority voices through its rating aggregation system (see Section~\ref{subsec:background_maxparc}).

\subsection{Variations of Liquid Democracy}
Several proposed extensions to liquid democracy aim to mitigate the limitations outlined above. While many models offer theoretical advantages, this section focuses on ranked delegation and weighted delegation -- two techniques that are not only promising from a fairness and soundness perspective but are also feasible to implement within vodle's existing architecture.

The challenges discussed in the previous section, such as delegation cycles, vote loss due to abstentions, and the emergence of super-voters, highlight inherent vulnerabilities in the standard liquid democracy model. To mitigate these issues, enhancements have been proposed that modify how delegations function. These include techniques that allow voters to specify multiple delegates or distribute their vote to multiple casting voters. Each approach introduces different trade-offs and requires algorithmic support to ensure sound and interpretable outcomes.

The following subsections present several such variations, along with the algorithms that can be used to implement them.
\subsection*{Ranked Delegation}\label{subsec:background_ranked_delegation}
Ranked delegation improves liquid democracy by allowing voters to list several trusted delegates in order of preference. Instead of choosing just one delegate, a voter can specify a ranked list so that if their top choice is unavailable (e.g. due to abstention or being a part of a delegation cycle) the system can use the next delegate specified.

Implementing ranked delegation requires a mechanism to decide among multiple possible delegation paths (routes that a vote can take through the delegation graph).
This is done through a \textit{delegation rule}, a function that, given a ranked delegation instance and a delegating voter, selects a unique path leading to a \textit{casting voter} \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

The following key properties help evaluate these delegation rules:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Guru Participation:} Ensures that a voter accepting delegated votes (a ``guru'') is never worse off by doing so. Receiving additional delegations should not decrease their influence over the final outcome \citep{kotsialou_riley_2020}. 
  \item \textbf{Confluence:} Guarantees that each delegating voter ends up with one clear and unambiguous delegation path. This property simplifies vote resolution and enhances transparency \citep{brill_liquid_2022}. 
  \item \textbf{Copy Robustness:} Prevents strategic manipulation where a voter might mimic their delegate's vote outside the system to gain extra influence. A copy-robust rule makes sure that duplicating a vote externally does not yield more combined power than a proper delegation \citep{brill_liquid_2022,behrens_2015}. 
\end{itemize}

The literature considers several delegation rules, each with distinct trade-offs:

\textbf{Depth-First Delegation (DFD):} Selects the path beginning with the highest-ranked delegate, even if the resulting chain is long. Although it prioritises individual trust preferences, DFD can violate guru participation \citep{kotsialou_riley_2020}.

\textbf{Breadth-First Delegation (BFD):} Chooses the shortest available delegation path and uses rankings only to resolve ties. This approach usually produces direct, predictable chains and satisfies guru participation, although it might sometimes assign a vote to a lower-ranked delegate \citep{kotsialou_riley_2020, brill_liquid_2022}.

\textbf{MinSum:} Balances path length and delegation quality by selecting the path with the lowest total sum of edge ranks. Due to this, MinSum avoids both unnecessarily long chains and poorly ranked delegations \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

\textbf{Diffusion:} Constructs delegation paths in stages by assigning votes layer by layer based on the lowest available rank at each step. This method tends to avoid poor delegations but can sometimes produce unintuitive outcomes due to its tie-breaking procedure \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

\textbf{Leximax:} Compares paths based on their worst-ranked edge. This ensures that especially low-ranked delegations are avoided early in the path while maintaining confluence \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

\textbf{BordaBranching:} Takes a global view of the delegation graph by selecting a branching that minimises the total rank across all delegation edges. It satisfies both guru participation and copy robustness, though it is more computationally intensive \citep{brill_liquid_2022}.

In summary, ranked delegation enhances liquid democracy by reducing the risk of lost votes. The choice of delegation rule not only affects system efficiency but also influences fairness and robustness. While simpler methods such as DFD and BFD are easier to implement, advanced rules like MinSum, Leximax, and BordaBranching offer stronger guarantees and are better suited for practical deployment in platforms such as vodle.

Based on these considerations, the project adopts the MinSum rule. It offers a clear trade-off between delegation quality, computational efficiency, and user interpretability, making it well-suited for deployment within vodle. By selecting the path with the lowest total rank sum, MinSum prioritises higher-ranked delegates while avoiding unnecessarily long or indirect chains. This supports user trust and clarity by ensuring that final delegation paths reflect stated preferences in an understandable way.


\subsection*{Weighted Delegation}\label{subsec:background_weighted_delegation}

Traditional delegation systems require voters to entrust their entire vote to a single delegate, creating risks such as vote loss or excessive concentration of power. Weighted delegation addresses these issues by allowing voters to divide their voting weight among multiple trusted individuals.

% Traditional delegation systems, which require voters to delegate their entire vote to a single individual, introduce significant risks such as vote loss through delegate abstentions, delegation cycles, and excessive concentration of voting power in the hands of a few super-voters. To mitigate these issues, weighted delegation allows voters to divide their voting power among multiple delegates, rather than assigning it entirely to one. This approach provides greater flexibility and robustness while preserving voter intent more accurately.

Weighted delegation offers several key advantages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Increased resilience:} Distributing votes across multiple delegates mitigates the effect of abstentions by individual delegates.
  \item \textbf{Reduced concentration of power:} Allowing partial votes to different delegates decreases the likelihood of any single delegate becoming a super-voter.
  \item \textbf{Enhanced voter expression:} Voters can more precisely express their preferences and trust levels by allocating voting power proportionally to multiple individuals.
\end{itemize}

Several methodologies for implementing weighted delegation have been explored in the literature, each with its strengths and weaknesses:

\subsubsection*{Equal Vote Distribution~\citep{degrave2014}}
\citeauthor{degrave2014}'s Equal Vote Distribution model offers a simple and intuitive approach but comes with significant limitations. In this system, voters must distribute their entire vote evenly among a selected group of delegates (not including those that abstain), without the ability to assign differing trust levels. Crucially, voters cannot allocate any portion of their vote to themselves: they must either delegate their full voting power or retain it entirely, severely limiting personal control. While Equal Vote Distribution is easy to implement and reduces the impact of delegate abstentions, its rigidity makes it unsuitable for systems like vodle that prioritise nuanced voter autonomy and trust expression.

\subsubsection*{Fractional Delegation~\citep{bersetche2024}}

\citeauthor{bersetche2024} proposes a generalisation of liquid democracy in which voters are allowed to divide their voting weight arbitrarily among multiple delegates, while optionally retaining a fraction for themselves. Each agent expresses their preferences through a delegation matrix, where each entry specifies the proportion of voting weight delegated to a given individual. This approach enables a more flexible expression of trust relationships compared to classical single-delegation models.

To ensure the system remains stable and to prevent cases such as delegation cycles, \citeauthor{bersetche2024} introduces an artificial agent, referred to as agent \(n+1\). Every delegation path carries a small probability (\(\varepsilon\)) of transferring the voting weight to this agent. This mechanism ensures that votes trapped in delegation cycles or excessively long chains are eventually absorbed, preventing them from destabilising the voting process. In the limit as \(\varepsilon \to 0\), the model approximates the classical behaviour of liquid democracy without losses, but with \(\varepsilon > 0\), it guarantees the existence of equilibrium states.

Votes absorbed by agent \(n+1\) are effectively considered lost. As a result, users who delegate without ultimately terminating in a direct voter may see a fraction of their influence dissipate. This diverges from standard liquid democracy approaches, where all delegated votes are ultimately assumed to participate in the outcome.

Overall, fractional delegation as formalised by Bersetche retains desirable properties such as self-selection, delegation consistency, and conservation of total voting weight (accounting for losses), while enabling more expressive delegation structures and guaranteeing equilibrium under mild conditions.


\subsubsection*{Trust Matrix Model (proposed by Heitzig)}

The Trust Matrix Model offers the most expressive form of weighted delegation but at the cost of substantial computational and usability complexity. By allowing voters to assign fine-grained trust values to multiple delegates (including themselves), it captures highly nuanced voting preferences. However, the iterative computation process to resolve final effective ratings can become resource-intensive, especially in densely connected networks, and may challenge user understanding due to the complexity of maintaining trust matrices. Nonetheless, this model aligns closely with vodle's emphasis on user autonomy and flexible participation, making it the most powerful option among weighted delegation strategies.

Let \( \text{rating}_{i,x} \) denote the direct rating that voter \( i \) assigns to option \( x \), and \( \text{eff}_{i,x} \) denote their final effective rating. Then, \( \text{eff}_{i,x} \) can be defined as a combination of the voter's own rating and the effective ratings of their delegates, determined by the trust levels specified:

\begin{gather}
  \text{eff}_{i,x} = \text{trust}_{i,i} \cdot \text{rating}_{i,x} + \sum_{j \neq i} \text{trust}_{i,j} \cdot \text{eff}_{j,x}
\end{gather}

Each voter's trust values must sum to exactly 1:
\[
\sum_{j} \text{trust}_{i,j} = 1
\]

The computation proceeds iteratively, with the effective ratings updated at each step based on the current estimates of delegates' effective ratings. This process continues until there is no longer a change in the effective ratings. Convergence is guaranteed when each voter has some non-zero self-trust (\( \text{trust}_{i,i} > 0 \)), as the system then forms a contraction mapping and Banach's fixed point theorem applies.

% The convergence property can be formalised as follows.

% \paragraph{Convergence Proof.}
% Let there be \( n \) voters and let \( \mathbf{r} = (r_1, \dots, r_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n \) represent the vector of direct ratings for a fixed option, where \( r_i \) is the rating voter \( i \) assigns directly.

% Let \( T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} \) be the \emph{trust matrix}, where \( T_{i,j} \) denotes the proportion of voter \( i \)'s trust allocated to voter \( j \). Assume that each row sums exactly to 1 and that each voter retains some nonzero self-trust (\( T_{i,i} > 0 \)).

% Let \( \mathbf{e}^{(k)} \in \mathbb{R}^n \) denote the vector of effective ratings at iteration \( k \), and define the update rule:
% \[
% \mathbf{e}^{(k+1)} = D \mathbf{r} + A \mathbf{e}^{(k)},
% \]
% where \( D = \text{diag}(T_{1,1}, \dots, T_{n,n}) \) and \( A_{i,j} = T_{i,j} \) for \( i \neq j \), \( A_{i,i} = 0 \).

% Define the function \( f: \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n \) by \( f(\mathbf{e}) = D \mathbf{r} + A \mathbf{e} \). We observe:
% \[
% \| f(\mathbf{e}) - f(\mathbf{e}') \|_\infty = \| A (\mathbf{e} - \mathbf{e}') \|_\infty \leq \| A \|_\infty \cdot \| \mathbf{e} - \mathbf{e}' \|_\infty,
% \]
% where \( \| A \|_\infty = \max_i \sum_{j} |A_{i,j}| < 1 \) due to the presence of nonzero self-trust.

% Thus, \( f \) is a contraction mapping. By Banach's Fixed-Point Theorem, there exists a unique fixed point \( \mathbf{e}^* \), and the sequence \( (\mathbf{e}^{(k)}) \) converges to \( \mathbf{e}^* \) from any starting point.

% \qed


This model offers the highest granularity and flexibility, allowing voters to finely express confidence across multiple delegates per option. However, it also introduces significant computational overhead and may scale poorly in densely connected delegation graphs. Additionally, users may find it difficult to understand or maintain trust matrices of this complexity, raising potential usability concerns in real-world systems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Equal Vote Distribution (Degrave)} excels in simplicity and ease of implementation, ensuring robustness through straightforward delegation. However, it significantly limits voter expression and prohibits voters from allocating votes to themselves.
  \item \textbf{Fractional Delegation (Bersetche)} provides greater flexibility, permitting detailed voter preference expression, including self-allocation of votes. This method increases both computational complexity and interface complexity.
  \item \textbf{Trust Matrix Model} offers the highest expressivity and detail in delegation relationships, capturing complex trust dynamics. However, this method entails substantial computational overhead and introduces complexity in terms of usability and understanding for voters.
\end{itemize}

Each weighted-delegation method balances voter expressivity, computational complexity, and ease of implementation differently. After evaluating these trade-offs, this project selects the trust matrix model for its high expressiveness and compatibility with vodle's principles of autonomy and transparency. While more computationally intensive, it captures nuanced trust relationships and enables fine-grained participation -- both essential for resilient, inclusive decision-making at scale.

\section{Existing Implementations of Liquid Democracy}
Having reviewed the theoretical background and proposed extensions to liquid democracy, this section explores real-world systems, examining two major implementations -- LiquidFeedback and Google Votes -- that offer valuable insights into the technical, social, and usability challenges of applying liquid democracy at scale.

\subsection{LiquidFeedback}
LiquidFeedback is one of the earliest and most influential real-world implementations of liquid democracy. Developed as an open-source platform, it was notably adopted by the German Pirate Party in 2010 to facilitate internal policy-making through online participation \citep{behrens_liquidfeedback_2014}. The platform allowed members to submit proposals, debate them in structured phases, and vote either directly or via transitive delegation.

In LiquidFeedback, users could choose different delegates for different topics, allowing them to assign their vote to someone they trusted on a specific issue. These choices remained in place until the user changed them, which meant that certain individuals could gradually accumulate more influence if others did not update their delegations. When multiple proposals were put forward, the system used a ranking-based voting method (the Schulze method) to decide which one should win. The Schulze method compares proposals in head-to-head matchups and identifies the option with the strongest overall support, even considering indirect chains of preference. This helped ensure that the winning proposal was broadly supported across the electorate. Importantly, LiquidFeedback only accepted a proposal if it clearly beat the default option of doing nothing, helping to avoid unnecessary or unpopular changes.


In practice, the Pirate Party's use of LiquidFeedback revealed several key dynamics relevant to this project. The platform was successful in enabling large-scale participation and crowdsourced policy formation, but it also demonstrated common risks of liquid democracy, such as the existence of super-voters(as discussed previously).

Another practical issue was the complexity of the system. LiquidFeedback was difficult to understand, especially for users unfamiliar with concepts such as transitive delegation or multi-stage voting, which limited its accessibility and contributed to declining engagement over time \citep{kling2015votingbehaviourpoweronline}.

For a platform like vodle, the experience of LiquidFeedback highlights several important design considerations. First, user interfaces must be intuitive enough to allow voters to participate without needing deep technical knowledge. Second, the user must know the status of their delegation at a glance - improving the understanding of the platform. Finally, ensuring that votes lead to visible and actionable outcomes is critical for maintaining user engagement.

%Overall, LiquidFeedback serves as both a proof of concept and a cautionary tale; demonstrating that liquid democracy can work at scale, but that thoughtful implementation is essential to avoid replicating the very problems it seeks to solve.
\subsection{Google Votes}\label{subsec:google_votes}
Google Votes was an internal experiment at Google designed to explore the practical application of liquid democracy within a corporate environment. Built on top of the company's internal Google+ social network, it operated between 2012 and 2015 and allowed employees to participate in decision making by either voting directly or delegating their vote to a colleague \citep{hardt_google_2015}.

Delegations in Google Votes were category-specific, meaning that users could choose different delegates for different areas of interest, such as food, events, or technical infrastructure. These delegations were persistent but could be overridden at any time, giving users flexibility to either rely on trusted experts or vote independently as needed. The system supported transitive delegation and allowed users to reclaim control by casting their own vote, even after delegating.

Figure~\ref{fig:google_votes} shows the user interface of Google Votes, highlighting how delegation and voting transparency were presented to users

These delegations were persistent but could be overridden at any time, giving users flexibility to either rely on trusted experts or vote independently as needed. The system supported transitive delegation and allowed users to reclaim control by casting their own vote, even after delegating.

The platform placed strong emphasis on usability and transparency. Delegation features were rolled out incrementally, with additional tools such as voting power estimates and delegation advertisements helping users understand their influence. One key design principle was what the authors called the ``Golden Rule of Liquid Democracy'': if a user delegates their vote, they should be able to see how it is being used. To accomplish this, users received notifications when their delegate voted, and all votes were visible to the relevant group. This encouraged accountability and gave voters confidence that their delegated votes were being used appropriately.

While Google Votes was never made publicly available, it served as a successful demonstration of liquid democracy in a structured, real-world setting. It showed that being able to delegate votes could improve engagement and decision making within large organisations, especially when designed with attention to user experience. For vodle, the system provides a concrete example of how features like topic-specific delegation, transparency tools, and real-time voting feedback can make liquid democracy more practical and accessible.
\section{Agent Based Modelling}\label{sec:background_abm}
Agent-based modelling (ABM) is a computational approach used to simulate the actions and interactions of autonomous agents in order to assess their effects on a system as a whole. It is particularly suited for exploring complex, dynamic systems where behaviour emerges from local interactions between individual entities (agents) rather than being dictated by central control. ABM has been widely applied in domains such as economics, sociology, and ecology to study decentralised systems, market dynamics, and collective behaviours \citep{bonabeau2002agent}.

The need to explore ABM arises due to the project's goal of introducing a weighted-delegation mechanism that hasn't been explored before into vodle. Traditional analysis alone may not effectively capture the dynamic interactions or unintended consequences that can emerge from this novel feature. Through ABM, it is possible to simulate realistic voting scenarios, track delegation chains, identify potential power imbalances, and anticipate challenges. These simulations can reveal performance insights and inform design decisions before implementing the mechanisms within the live platform.

Several agent-based modelling (ABM) frameworks were considered for simulating delegation dynamics.

\textbf{NetLogo}~\citep{netlogo} is highly accessible and well-suited for small-scale or educational simulations. However, it lacks native support for complex data structures and scalable computation, making it less suitable for the detailed delegation networks required in this project.

\textbf{Repast}~\citep{repast} provides powerful distributed simulation capabilities and fine-grained agent behaviour modelling. Nonetheless, its steep learning curve and extensive configuration overhead conflicted with the project's time constraints.

\textbf{Agents.jl}~\citep{agentsjl} offers high performance through the Julia language, particularly for large-scale agent systems. However, its relatively immature ecosystem for data analysis and visualisation posed integration challenges compared to more established Python-based frameworks.

\textbf{Mesa}~\citep{kazil_utilizing_2020} was ultimately selected. Written in Python, Mesa integrates seamlessly with scientific computing libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib. It supports dynamic agent behaviour, networked interactions, and real-time visualisation -- all critical for modelling complex delegation chains and analysing system dynamics efficiently. Mesa therefore offered the best balance between expressiveness, ease of development, and computational flexibility, making it the optimal choice for this project.

\section{Vodle}
Having established the broader context of liquid democracy and examined existing systems, this section introduces vodle -- the platform into which these mechanisms are integrated.
Vodle is a web-based decision-making tool designed to support participatory group processes through interactive polls and transparent aggregation methods. It allows users to rate decision options on a 0-100 scale using sliders, encouraging nuanced input and fostering compromise.

The section outlines vodle's core architecture, including its underlying rating system (MaxParC) and the technologies that support its operation. These technical foundations played a critical role in shaping the design and feasibility of the advanced delegation features developed during this project.

\subsection{MaxParC}\label{subsec:background_maxparc}
MaxParC (Maximum Partial Consensus) is the rating system used in vodle to aggregate user preferences and determine poll outcomes. Introduced by \citet{heitzig_fair_2024}, MaxParC was designed to address common limitations of traditional voting systems, particularly the tendency for majority rule to overlook minority preferences. Its goal is to balance fairness, consensus, and efficiency in collective decision making.

In MaxParC, each user rates an option on a scale from $0$ to $100$. This rating reflects the user's willingness to approve that option based on how many other users also support it. Specifically, a rating of $x$ means that the voter will approve the option if fewer than $x\%$ of participants disapprove. A rating of $0$ means the option is never approved, while $100$ means it is always approved regardless of others' opinions. This structure transforms a simple rating into a conditional approval, allowing for a more nuanced expression of preferences with the potential for compromise.

\end{figure}

Understanding how MaxParC processes ratings is essential for this project, as the proposed weighted delegation mechanism must operate within its conditional approval framework. When a user splits their vote among multiple delegates, the system must ensure that their own rating continues to contribute appropriately. Specifically, if a user delegates $x\%$ of their rating to others, their final rating must not fall below $(100-x)\%$ of their original input. This constraint guarantees that the user's approval remains proportionally represented, even when part of their voting power is passed on to others.

Integrating liquid democracy into vodle therefore requires careful design to align with MaxParC's logic, ensuring both technical compatibility and conceptual consistency.

\subsection{Technical Architecture and Implementation Constraints}
Understanding vodle's technology stack is crucial for the successful integration of liquid democracy features into the platform. As the project adds complex delegation and voting logic, it is important to understand the technological constraints of vodle, which directly influence design and implementation choices.

\subsection*{Angular}
Vodle is built with Angular \citep{angular}, a TypeScript-based frontend framework created by Google. Angular's modularity and structured component system provide a strong foundation for incremental development, essential when introducing new features such as ranked delegation that build upon existing components. Its clear separation of concerns helps maintain readable and maintainable code, simplifying debugging and future enhancements -- particularly beneficial given the expected growth in delegation logic complexity during the project.

\subsection*{Ionic Framework}
The Ionic \citep{ionic} framework complements Angular by enabling the creation of responsive, mobile-compatible applications from a single codebase. Given vodle's goal of broad user participation, Ionic ensures consistent functionality across both desktop and mobile devices. %need to make sure its compatible 
New delegation features must integrate seamlessly with the existing Ionic framework to ensure usability and visual appeal across platforms, including mobile devices.

\subsection*{CouchDB}
CouchDB \citep{couchdb} is vodle's primary database, communicating directly with the client through HTTP requests without a dedicated backend. This architecture places significant computational responsibilities on the client-side Angular application, including the handling of delegation chains, cycle detection, and the computation of final vote outcomes. Furthermore, as CouchDB stores data exclusively as JSON documents, complex delegation structures and voting relationships must be serialised and deserialised on the client side.

The lack of server-side computation means the delegation algorithms must be designed with client-side efficiency in mind, ensuring performance remains acceptable even as delegation complexity increases. Thus, the choice of algorithms for liquid democracy features, such as those to resolve conflicting delegation paths, is directly influenced by CouchDB's architectural constraints.

These technological considerations (covered in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:design_architecture}) strongly shaped the practical implementation of liquid democracy in vodle. They necessitated a focus on efficient client-side logic as well as careful management of data flow.

\subsection{Partially Implemented Delegation in Vodle}\label{subsec:background_existing_delegation}
At the start of the project, vodle contained a partially implemented, currently disabled delegation system.  
Although never deployed in a working state, this prototype included an invitation-based mechanism for initiating delegations and early user interface components to support the feature.

However, the implementation lacked several core features required for wide-scale deployment. Most notably, it failed to reliably detect or prevent delegation cycles. Since delegation graphs were stored only in each user's local memory, clients could have inconsistent views of the system. This meant that delegation actions appearing valid on one browser could later form cycles as other users updated their delegations, compromising system reliability.

These initial limitations -- especially the absence of consistent cycle prevention and consistent delegation states -- defined the key technical challenges addressed during the system redesign, which is discussed in detail in Chapter~\ref{ch:design_implementation}.
% \subsection{Design Philosophy -- TODO}

% \section{Summary}
% The background research presented in this chapter has provided the necessary foundation for designing and implementing advanced delegation features within vodle.
% The research highlighted critical limitations in traditional liquid democracy systems, including delegation cycles, abstention risks, and the disproportionate influence of super-voters.

% In response, several promising delegation strategies were identified, particularly ranked and weighted delegation.
% Ranked delegation was found to be an effective approach for reducing the risk of lost votes, with the MinSum delegation rule being particularly suitable due to its clear balance of efficiency, interpretability, and fairness.

% Weighted delegation was identified as a valuable strategy to allow voters greater flexibility by distributing their influence among multiple trusted delegates.
% Additionally, the concept of delegating different options to distinct delegates was supported by practical experiences from Google Votes, where topic-specific delegations improved user engagement and representation accuracy.

% Among the weighted delegation methods explored, the trust matrix model stood out for its expressiveness and alignment with vodle's goals of user autonomy and flexibility.
% By allowing voters to articulate nuanced trust relationships across multiple delegates, including themselves, the model offers a compelling balance between representation quality and individual control.

% While more computationally intensive than simpler approaches, it presents a viable strategy for robust weighted delegation within a real-time voting system.
% The technological constraints of vodle itself, especially the reliance on client-side processing due to the CouchDB architecture, demonstrated the need for efficient, lightweight implementation strategies.

% These insights collectively define the project's objectives, which are formalised in the following chapter.
