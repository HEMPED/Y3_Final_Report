\chapter{Evaluation}\label{ch:evaluation}

This chapter evaluates the design and implementation of the delegation features introduced into vodle, assessing their effectiveness against the original objectives and requirements. It reviews the testing methodology, evaluates completion against functional and non-functional requirements, discusses performance results, presents feedback received, identifies limitations, and concludes with an overall assessment.

\section{Testing}

Testing was conducted through a combination of manual exploratory testing, targeted unit tests, and integration testing across multiple devices and user accounts. Key areas of focus included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Correct resolution of delegation graphs under standard, ranked, weighted, and per-option delegation modes.
    \item Enforcement of cycle prevention at delegation acceptance.
    \item Correct override behaviour when users cast direct votes.
    \item Cross-device synchronisation of delegation changes via CouchDB replication.
    \item Responsiveness of delegation operations under scaling to 200 users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance Evaluation}

Performance testing indicated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cycle Detection:} Constant-time validation (Section 4.2.2).
    \item \textbf{Delegation Resolution:} Millisecond-level resolution time up to 200 users (Section 5.3).
    \item \textbf{Weighted Computations:} Trust matrix convergence within few iterations (Section 4.5.3).
    \item \textbf{Cross-Client Synchronisation:} CouchDB replication delay under 5 seconds (Section 5.3).
    \item \textbf{Scalability:} Acceptable for target size; client-only architecture may limit extreme scaling.
\end{itemize}

\section{Feedback}

Feedback from the customer (Jobst Heitzig) included:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Strong support for the trust matrix weighted delegation mechanism.
    \item Positive feedback on usability improvements for ranked delegation.
    \item Concerns about complexity of trust weight adjustment for casual users.
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Client-Side Computation:} Resolution and weighting handled locally.
    \item \textbf{Eventual Consistency:} Replication model leads to brief inconsistencies.
    \item \textbf{Trust Matrix Complexity:} Advanced users manage easily; casual users may struggle.
    \item \textbf{Simulation Extension:} Agent-based modelling not completed due to descoping.
\end{itemize}

\section{Overall Assessment}

The project successfully delivered a robust, flexible delegation system for vodle. Core, ranked, per-option, and weighted mechanisms were all implemented, addressing major technical and usability challenges. Despite descoping the simulation extension, the work provides a strong foundation for future development and deployment.
