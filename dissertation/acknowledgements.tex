\begin{abstract}
I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Markus Brill, for his guidance and support throughout this project. His extensive knowledge of liquid democracy was invaluable in helping to shape both the theoretical foundations and the practical design decisions of the work. His feedback was consistently insightful and helped refine the project's direction at every stage.

I am also grateful to my co-supervisor, Jobst Heitzig, for his ongoing support during development. As the main developer of vodle and acting as the project's customer, his insights into the platform's requirements and goals were essential for the successful integration of liquid democracy features. The weighted delegation mechanism based on a trust matrix model, which forms a key part of the final system, was also proposed by him. His technical guidance and responsiveness throughout the project were greatly appreciated.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support and encouragement during the course of this project. Their patience, understanding, and belief in me provided important motivation throughout the development process.
