%Through the background research, we identified several key limitations in traditional liquid democracy systems such as delegation cycles, vote loss through abstentions, and the disproportionate influence of super-voters. We also explored a number of proposed enhancements, including ranked delegation and vote splitting, which offer practical ways to improve the fairness delegative voting.
The background research as well as the project's goal and motivation have laid out the objectives for the project. This section outlines the objectives.
%Based on these findings, a set of features that would improve vodle and make the integration of liquid democracy within it more beneficial. These can be formalised into the following core objectives:
\section{Project Objectives.}
\label{section:project_objectives}
Objectives are split into core and extended objectives. Core objectives are prioritised as they aligned more closely to the project's main goal.

Core Objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement a Core Delegation Model into vodle: } Build upon the existing, partially implemented delegation code within the vodle platform to create a fully functional system, including resolving key challenges such as cyclic delegations.

    \item \textbf{Implement Ranked Delegation into vodle: } Add a backup delegation mechanism to vodle, allowing users to specify an ordered list of up to 3 delegates, and using the MinSum algorithm to determine the activated delegation paths.

    \item \textbf{Implement a Vote Splitting Delegation Variation into vodle: } Add functionality to vodle to delegate fractions of their rating to different delegates. Use the \textit{will come back to when research written up} system to calculate final ratings.

    \item \textbf{Implement Ability to Delegate Options to Different Users}: Allow users to delegate the ratings of specific options to different delegates.
\end{enumerate}

Extension Objective:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simulate Delegation Mechanisms: } Perform agent-based modelling to analyse the effectiveness of various delegation systems, including those outlined in Objectives 1, 2 and 3.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Requirements}
intro - talk about why we need to break down objectives further, define functional and non functional requirements.

break each objective down into F and NF.
