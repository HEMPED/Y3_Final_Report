I would like to sincerely thank my supervisor, Markus Brill, for his guidance and support throughout this project. His extensive knowledge of liquid democracy was invaluable in shaping both the theoretical foundations and practical design decisions. His feedback was consistently insightful and helped refine the project's direction at every stage.

I am also deeply grateful to my co-supervisor, Jobst Heitzig, who, in addition to providing technical guidance, served as the project's customer. His insights into the system's requirements and goals were essential for the successful integration of liquid democracy features. He also proposed the trust-based weighted delegation model that became a key part of the final system. His responsiveness and advice throughout development were greatly appreciated.

Finally, I would like to thank my family and friends for their unwavering support and encouragement. Their patience, understanding, and belief in me provided vital motivation throughout the project.
