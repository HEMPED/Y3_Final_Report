Liquid democracy is a hybrid decision-making model that allows individuals to either vote directly or delegate their vote to a trusted peer. This project integrates a comprehensive liquid democracy system into vodle, a web-based group decision-making platform, to support more flexible and inclusive participation.

The implementation introduces several key features: transitive delegation, ranked delegation with fall back options, per-option delegation, and a novel vote splitting mechanism based on a trust matrix model. This trust matrix approach -- originally proposed by co-supervisor Jobst Heitzig -- allows users to express nuanced trust across multiple delegates and was selected as the final vote splitting algorithm for its high expressivity and alignment with vodle's goals of autonomy and transparency.

By combining technical innovations with an intuitive interface, this project enables vodle to adapt to users' varying levels of engagement and expertise. The resulting system empowers users to participate meaningfully in collective decisions without requiring constant direct input, making liquid democracy practical for real-time, web-based environments.
