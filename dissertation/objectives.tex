\chapter{Project Objectives}
\label{ch:project_objectives}
This chapter outlines the objectives of the project. Derived from the background research, they address the technical and theoretical challenges identified with traditional delegation systems.

To manage the project effectively, the objectives are divided into two categories. Core objectives form the backbone of the implementation and are essential to meeting the project's main goals, while extension objectives provide additional insight or value.

Later in the chapter, each objective is broken down into specific functional and non-functional requirements. This structure clarifies expectations, guides implementation, and provides clear criteria for evaluating whether each objective has been met.

Core Objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement a Core Delegation Model into Vodle: } Build upon the existing, partially implemented delegation code within the vodle platform to create a fully functional system, including resolving key challenges such as cyclic delegations.

    \item \textbf{Implement Ranked Delegation into Vodle: } Add a backup delegation mechanism to vodle, allowing users to specify up to three delegates.

    \item \textbf{Implement a Weighted Delegation into Vodle: } Add functionality to allow users to delegate fractions of their rating to multiple delegates, using the trust matrix model to calculate final ratings.

    \item \textbf{Implement Per-Option Delegation}: Allow users to delegate the ratings of specific options to different delegates.
\end{enumerate}

Extension Objective:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Simulate Delegation Mechanisms: } Perform agent-based modelling to analyse the effectiveness of various delegation systems, including those outlined in Core Objectives 1-3.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Requirements}
The project objectives represent high-level goals that must be translated into specific, actionable requirements. This process clarifies scope, ensures comprehensive coverage of each objective, and establishes a structured foundation for both implementation and evaluation.

To support this, requirements are organised into two categories: functional (F) and non-functional (NF). Functional requirements describe the core behaviours and features the system must support, while non-functional requirements define performance, usability, and other quality-related constraints \citep{sommervill_2016}. Distinguishing between these categories helps ensure that both the system's functionality and overall user experience are properly addressed.

Each requirement is formulated to be measurable and testable. This enables objective evaluation during development, facilitates verification against the project goals, and helps identify areas for improvement as the system evolves.

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1:} The system shall correctly handle the delegation process from invitation to acceptance.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{FR1.1:} The system shall allow users to invite others to act as their delegate.
        \item \textbf{FR1.2:} The system shall allow invited users to accept delegation requests.
        \item \textbf{FR1.3:} The system shall prevent users from accepting their own delegation invitations.
        \item \textbf{FR1.4:} The system shall detect and prevent the formation of delegation cycles.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{FR2:} The system shall provide users with a clear view of their current delegation, including the ability to revoke it at any time.

    \item \textbf{FR3:} The system shall resolve delegations transitively, such that if User A delegates to B and B delegates to C, User C is the final casting voter for A's vote.

    \item \textbf{FR4:} The system shall allow users to override a delegate's decision for specific poll options by submitting a direct vote.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NFR1:} All delegation-related data must be stored in a JSON-encoded format, ensuring compatibility with the existing vodle CouchDB database.
    \item \textbf{NFR2:} Any changes to the database schema must be backward compatible, ensuring that existing data is not lost or corrupted during the upgrade process.
    \item \textbf{NFR3:} The system shall preserve user privacy by ensuring that individual voting preferences and delegation choices are not visible to other users. The only information visible to a delegated user shall be the final vote cast on their behalf.
    \item \textbf{NFR4:} The user interface for delegation shall be intuitive and accessible, with clear instructions and minimal friction to perform delegation actions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implement Ranked Delegation into Vodle}\label{subsec:requirements_ranked_delegation}

\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1:} The system shall allow users to specify a ranked list of up to 3 delegates for each poll, with the ranking applying to all options within that poll.
    
    \item \textbf{FR2:} The system shall apply the MinSum delegation rule to resolve each voter's delegation path based on their ranked list of delegates.
    
    \item \textbf{FR3:} The system shall allow users to override the ranked delegation by submitting a direct vote for specific poll options.
    
    \item \textbf{FR4:} The system shall provide users with a clear view of their ranked delegation choices, including the ability to alter their rankings or revoke them at any time.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NFR1:} The user interface for ranked delegation shall be intuitive and accessible, with clear instructions and minimal friction to perform delegation actions.
    
    \item \textbf{NFR2:} The system shall ensure that any data related to ranked delegation is stored in a JSON-encoded format, ensuring compatibility with the existing vodle CouchDB database.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Implement Weighted Delegation into Vodle}\label{subsec:requirements_weighte}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1:} The system shall allow users to delegate their vote to multiple delegates simultaneously for a single poll.

    \item \textbf{FR2:} The system shall allow users to assign a weight to each delegate such that the total weight does not exceed 0.99.

    \item \textbf{FR3:} The system shall calculate the final rating for each option using the weighted delegation model based on the trust matrix approach (see Section~\ref{subsec:background_weighted_delegation}).
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NFR1:} The system shall ensure that weighted delegation calculations are performed entirely on the client side to comply with vodle's CouchDB architecture.

    \item \textbf{NFR2:} All related data must be serialised as JSON strings to ensure compatibility with the CouchDB backend.

    \item \textbf{NFR3:} The user interface for weighted delegation shall be intuitive and allow users to adjust weights easily, using sliders or numeric inputs.

\subsection{Implement Per-Option Delegation}\label{subsec:requirements_option}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{FR1:} The system shall allow users to assign different delegates for each individual option or subset of options within a poll.

    \item \textbf{FR2:} The system shall ensure that each delegated option is resolved independently, using the appropriate delegate's vote for that option.

    \item \textbf{FR3:} The system shall allow users to override a delegate's vote for a specific option by providing their own rating.

    \item \textbf{FR4:} The system shall enable users to view and revoke individual delegations via the user interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Non-Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{NFR1:} The delegation interface shall clearly display the assigned delegate for each option and allow users to identify and manage delegations with minimal steps.

    \item \textbf{NFR2:} The delegation data must be serialised in a format compatible with CouchDB (e.g., JSON-encoded) to maintain compatibility with vodle's storage system.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Simulate Delegation Mechanisms}\label{subsec:requirements_sim}
\subsubsection{Functional Requirements}

    \item \textbf{FR2:} The system shall support multiple delegation mechanisms, including standard transitive delegation, ranked delegation (with the MinSum delegation rule), and weighted delegation.

    \item \textbf{FR3:} The system shall allow configuration of simulation parameters such as number of agents, delegation probabilities and abstention rates.

    \item \textbf{FR4:} The system shall track and record key metrics such as vote concentration, number of super-voters, average chain length, vote loss due to abstentions or cycles, and final decision alignment with initial voter intent.

    \item \textbf{FR5:} The system shall output simulation results in a structured format (e.g. CSV or JSON) for further analysis.
