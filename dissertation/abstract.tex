    % Liquid democracy offers a flexible alternative to traditional voting methods, allowing individuals to either vote directly or delegate their vote to trusted peers. This project integrates a full liquid democracy system into vodle, a web-based group decision-making platform, to support broader and more accessible participation.
    % Several variations of liquid democracy were developed: ranked delegation with backup options, per-option delegation, and weighted delegation based on user-defined trust. These innovations give users more control over how their votes are cast, even when they are not directly participating.
    % By combining these delegation features with an intuitive interface, the platform makes liquid democracy practical for real-time, web-based environments.
    Liquid democracy offers a flexible alternative to traditional voting, allowing individuals either to vote directly or to delegate their vote to trusted peers. This project integrates a full liquid democracy system (including transitive vote delegation) into vodle, a web-based group decision-making platform, to promote broader participation. Several variations were developed: ranked delegation with backup options, per-option delegation, and a trust-based weighted delegation model that enables fine-grained expression of user confidence. These innovations give users greater control over how their votes are cast, even when not directly participating. Performance benchmarks indicate that the delegation algorithm resolves votes within milliseconds for hundreds of users, validating the approach. By combining flexible delegation mechanisms with an intuitive, real-time interface, vodle demonstrates the practical viability of liquid democracy for modern, web-based environments.
